## How do I get it ##

Since Elisp is part of Emacs, you need to get emacs first.  Emacs can be installed from it's [home page](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
It's available for Windows, BSD, Linux and BSD'S too.  Go ahead and download it and follow the instructions.


## Welcome to E-Lisp ##

With Emacs running, you now have access to Elisp, you can either access it directly in Emacs or you can use the built in 
reply, called IELM (Interactive ELisp Mode) (by clicking Alt-X then type in **ielm** then hit enter).
In either window, you type the elisp code and then at the end of the window, you type *Ctrl-X, Ctrl-E*.
For our first , we'll use the *SCRATCH* window and type in a simple "Hello World" program.  
IN that buffer ,type in:

```
(format "Hello, World")

```
Move your cursor to the end of the list (which is the ")" symbol, both symbols will light up showing that
you have a closed list

At this point, hit *Ctrl-X, Ctrl-E*  (Control-X then Control-E) and Emacs will show you your result in the message window:
