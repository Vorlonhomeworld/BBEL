## History of Emacs

   ***"... In the beginning was the word, and the word was 'Emacs', and the word was good!"***

   *The book of Emacs, Chapter 1, verse 1*


   Elisp is tied to Emacs, so no history of Elisp can be told correctly without mentioning
  Emacs itself.  Emacs started life as a set of Macros for an editor running in the MIT lab called
  "Teco".

  Teco was an acromnym for "Text Editor and Corrector", which was the name of the program
  *and* the programming language used to code it with.  In the 1970's Richard Stallman was
  also at MIT and added a "real-time edit mode" , which was a novelty at that time, to
  update the text on screen as it was being edited.  This mode allowed other users to
  bind key strokes to the existing TECO programs. Guy Steele coordinated a set of
  key strokes (macros) among all the users and this is what evolved into the first version
  of Emacs (Emacs is an acronym that stands for "Editor Macros").

  Emacs grew in popularity and Emacs was re-written in Lisp for the Lisp Machine, then in
  ZWEI  (This is an acromyn as well "Zwei was EINE initially"), then MacLisp. Then Emacs
  became "Gosling Emacs" and it was written in C and MLisp (Mock Lisp), written by
  James Gosling, and initally distributed with no formal restrictions, however, that
  changed when he sold the program to UniPress. Now, Mock Lisp   looked like Lisp but it was
  deemed to be too limietd to be usable.  Stallman liked having
  Lisp act as both the extension language and the actual code, however, Lisp machines (which was
  the only way to run Lisp back then) weren't widely avaialable, so he began replacing  Mock Lisp
  with what would become Elisp in 1984.
  

  Coincidentally, Richard Stallman **also** developed his GNU General Public license at the
  same time.  WHen he built *his* Emacs, he built it on top of Gosling Emacs which was a
  commercial version from Unipress. They got a bit preturbed and ordered him to stop
  distributing *his* version of Emacs, which forced him to literally re-write the rest of
  Emacs so as to remove all of Gosling Emacs' code. Thus the GNU General Public License was born
  so that no other user would have to go through what he did.


  ### Creation of Elisp ###

  ***"...Then Stallman spoke and said 'Let there be Elisp', and there was Elisp, and the Elisp was good"***

  *The book of Emacs, Chapter 1, verse 2*

  When Richard Stallman was ordered to stop distributing his version of Gosling Emacs and decided
  to recode his version, he wanted it to be extensible, that is, he wanted the users to be able to
  define pretty much anything they wanted.  The prior language, TECO , EINE, ZWEI and Mock Lisp
  were either *too* obscure or *too* weak to do this with. However, there was this *new* version
  of Lisp, developed right in MIT called MacLisp which looked really promising to Stallman.
  This version of Lisp, however, only ran on PDP-6 and PDP-10 mainframe computer and wouldn't
  be usable to everyone as he wanted it to be, so he decided to code his own version of
  Lisp based on MacLisp.

  Richard Stallman incorporated his ideals of the GNU General Public License by allowing
  anyone to see and change the source code *and* actively enocourage users to do this.
  He even made it possible for anyone, even those without programming experience, to
  modify Emacs for their own needs.  The book "Introduction to Programming in Emacs
  Lisp" is freely available within Emacs itself (although you *can* buy the book too if you'd like!)
  as is the Emacs Lisp reference manual.

  Emacs Lisp was designed with three main goals in mind:

  * Elisp should be easily available to anyone that wants it and they anyone should
    be able to customize Emacs to their own needs with it, even if they have no
    programming experience at all. For this reason, Elisp is considered an "incomplete"
    language, in that there are things the language can't do and shouldn't need to
    do outside of Emacs, and that's done so that there's less to learn and it's easier
    to master.


  * Users should be able to find code easy so they can customize Emacs. To that end
    docstrings are strongly encouraged so that any part of the code is easily understood.
    Anything that makes the code harder to read or see is actively discouraged within
    Elisp

    
  * Elisp should be able to be run on as many platforms as possible. This is why
    Emacs runs a byte-code interpreter



  ### Is Elisp Lisp or something else ### 


Elisp **is** Lisp. However, Lisp is a pretty big family. Lisp started out as just
Lisp 1.0 and now inlcudes MacLisp, Scheme , ZIL (Zork Implementation Language (If you
ever played an Infocom game, it was written in this language, as was their database,
Cornerstone!), Scheme, CLojure, Gnu Guile, Racket, and pretty much anything else
with "Lisp" in it's name.     That said, Elisp is closest to Lisp-2 in it's design,
meaning the namepsaces for functions and other ordinary values are seperate and
to call any function bound to a variable, you need to use *funcall*. Also, symbols
can *also* be used a function values.   What this means is , if you know, for example,
Common Lisp, some of what you know *will* actually work, some *may* work, but you
need to change it slightly, for example, if you want to run "Hello, World" in
Common Lisp, you would type:

*(defun hello ()*
*(format t "Hello, World!"))*

That would run and you would get:

*Hello, World!*


However, if you try that in Elisp, you would get an error:

*Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp t)*

This would let know know that Elisp doesn't understand the "t" in the "format t" statement.

You would have to remove the "t" from the format statement to end up with:

*defun hello()*
*(format "Hello, World!"))*

That will run without any kind of error at all!

So, while it *is* Lisp, it's certainly not the same as Common Lisp at all.
