The Big Book of Elisp

I got interested in Emacs and shortly thereafter, in Elisp. Now that I'm running EXWM , I really got interested in
learning Elisp and found very little in the way of books available. So I decided to teach myself and put into 
book form what I'm learning. This is freely available, anyone can copy it and modify it.

Enjoy!
